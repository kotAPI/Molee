				<div id="section-1">				
					I am a freelance digital artist and I was born and raised in New-Delhi. I started drawing when I was around three years old. I am self-taught and I didn't go to any art school as such. Drawing was my passion since I was a kid and I barely took any interest in school studies.
					I wasn’t the best student in my class LOL! In fact I never liked anything else other than painting, reading comics and playing video games.
					After finishing my school I joined Bachelor’s of Fine Art but I left in the second week it-self because I didn’t like how they made art into some kind of engineering like subject with rules which MUST be followed, I always felt art is something that should be done with complete freedom. So it was completely against my principles, plus the professors seemed to be very frustrated and uptight. I joined Law College afterwards but it wasn’t my cup of tea and left it near the end of the first semester.
					I realized that college wasn’t meant for me so I decided not to go to a college at all; I never really wanted a degree either. In fact this decision helped me start my career early and it’s going pretty well for me. But then again it doesn’t mean that I’ll advise everyone to leave college, it completely depends from person to person.
					I just finished reading the Mahabharata recently and I am trying to paint each and every character (at least the major ones) the way they are described in the text… not sure if that can be considered a project
				</div>
				<div id="section-2">
					I already had love for Indian mythology since I was a kid when I used to listen to the stories of the battle between gods and demons. I used to love watching television shows based on Indian mythology when I was small. Some might mistake me to be a very religious person when in fact I am not religious at all! Though I do believe in the philosophy of the Vedas and that god is one and his names are many, It’s mainly patriotism that has driven me and also concern regarding that so many are ignorant about the beautiful stories this ancient culture has to offer. I have faced a lot of problem because of my unconventional depictions, though I based them of off what I have read from the scriptures and the artworks I see in ancient temples. I recently was threatened by religious fanatics during my exhibition in Bengaluru in February and three of my paintings were asked to be removed for nudity, though my inspiration for those paintings was from the temple art that is from ancient Indian temples. The irony is that one of the most famous temples with nude artworks is the Halebidu temple in Karnataka. Another irony is that I was being branded an anti-Hindu though I have encouraged people to read the Vedas and epics like Mahabharata and have been successful to an extent in doing so. I can only laugh thinking about it - 

					Follow what your heart says, that’s all and don’t give a damn what people tell you. -
